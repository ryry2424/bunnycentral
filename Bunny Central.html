<p>&nbsp &nbsp Your bunny can be a very fun pet, but here are some tips on how to get the most out of your bunny:
<br>
<br>
1. Tricks
<br>
<p>	Bunnies can not, unfortunately, do many tricks, so to get the best out of your bunny you should try putting random stuff on it's head. Some say that it's cruel, but really deep down in that little bunny heart, there is joy and comfort in having random stuff on it's head.</p> 
2. Patience
<br>
<p> When starting to put things onto your bunnies head you need lots of patience. The bunny might resist the new eroma of having something on it's head, but don't be discouraged because this new practice will eventually be taken into the bunnies day to day life.</p>
3. Diets
<br>
<p> Your bunnies love to eat treats, but sometimes feeding too many treats can be bad for your pet. It's important to remember that the more treats you give your bunny, the more it will expect during training sessions.</p>
4. Costumes
<br>
<p> Bunnies are a lot more fun in costumes, but costumes on your bunny could hurt it or irritate your lovely pet. To avoid this, we would recomend staying away from costumes.</p>
5. Hats
<br>
<p> We strongly recomend getting hats for your bunny. A hat for your bunny can be anything you want it be from cowboy hats to our signature ice cream cones. Check out our exclusive products and new content! Save! Save! Save!</p>
